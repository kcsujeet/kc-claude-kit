## Rules

Code that reads well and is wrong is still wrong. Walk every change for the bugs a reader skims past.

- Consider the empty, null, zero and boundary input on every path you add or change, not only the value the feature was built for.
- Check every operator and condition for an off-by-one or an inversion: `<` against `<=`, `&&` against `||`, a negation that flips the meaning.
- Keep dependency arrays and closures current: an effect, memo, callback or handler reads the latest value of everything it uses.
- Do not let a cast hide a real type mismatch. When data crossing a boundary (an API response, props, storage) does not match its declared type, fix the type or parse the value.
- Before changing code, check the repo's history for a bug already fixed there (the changelog, dev logs, `git log -S <symbol>`), so the change does not bring it back.

Detection criteria and per-box review failure modes live in the `## Review checklist` of the `correctness` skill (`conventions:correctness`), with the detail under its `## Review detail`. These rules are the statement of the convention; that checklist is how a diff gets graded against it.

## Review checklist

The correctness gate agent ticks every box against the diff. A box is FAIL if any matching construct violates the rule; the gate is FAIL if any box is FAIL. Each box states its own N/A condition.

- [ ] §B1 Logic: no off-by-one, wrong operator, inverted condition, stale state or closure (an effect, callback or handler reading a value captured before it changed), or wrong dependency array (a value the body reads is missing, or a listed value changes every render). (N/A: the diff adds or changes no condition, loop, index or range arithmetic, state update, closure, or dependency array)
- [ ] §B2 Edge cases: every added or changed path handles empty collections, null/undefined, zero, and boundary values (first, last, exactly at a limit), and every date or time the diff formats or parses uses the configured timezone rather than the machine's. (N/A: the diff changes no path that takes input, and formats or parses no date or time)
- [ ] §B3 Data shape: values crossing a boundary (an API response, props, storage, a URL or form value) match their declared type at runtime. A cast or `any` that lets a real mismatch through is a finding here; the syntax of the escape hatch itself is clarity §C17. (N/A: no value crosses a boundary in the diff)
- [ ] §B4 Regression: the diff does not reintroduce a bug the repo already fixed. The changelog, the dev logs (when the repo keeps them) and `git log -S <symbol>` were checked for every touched symbol, and the receipt names what was searched. (N/A: the diff only adds new files and touches no existing symbol)

**Point, do not double-report.** A removed export or a changed shared prop shape is structure §S10. A cast asserting a type the value does not have, as syntax, is clarity §C17. Duplicated markup, dead imports, or props threaded through and never read after a refactor are simplicity §P9. A locale formatter with no explicit time zone is datetime §D7. When a bug and one of those boxes describe the same line, report it once, under the closer fit, and name the other box in the evidence.

## Review detail

Bug rules for the diff under review. Covers four independent failure modes: logic that computes the wrong thing, inputs the code does not handle, data that is not the shape its type claims, and a fix the repo already made being undone.

**Every finding is verified before it is reported.** Open the actual file at the actual line at the head SHA (`git show <sha>:<path>`) and confirm the bug exists there; a finding from a hunk alone, or from another agent's summary, is not verified. **A claim about library or platform behavior** (a date library, a recurrence library, React, `Intl`, a CSS framework, a remote API) **cites the documentation fetched or the installed source read this session**, inline in the finding. Cached knowledge drifts between versions.

### §B1. Logic

Walk each changed condition, loop and state update, and ask what it computes, not what it was meant to compute:

- **Off-by-one:** `<` against `<=`, `length` against `length - 1`, an exclusive end treated as inclusive, a loop that skips the first or last item.
- **Wrong operator:** `&&` where `||` was meant, `=` or `==` where `===` was meant, `??` where `||` was meant (or the reverse, when `0` or `''` is a real value).
- **Inverted condition:** a negation that flips the branch, an early return guarding the wrong case.
- **Stale state or closure:** an effect, callback, timer or event handler that captured a value and keeps reading it after it changed; a state update computed from the previous render's value where the functional form was needed.
- **Wrong dependency array:** a value the body reads is missing, so the effect or memo runs against a stale value; or a listed value is a new object every render, so it runs every time.

### §B2. Edge cases

For each changed path, feed it the inputs the feature was not built around: an empty array or string, `null` and `undefined`, `0`, a negative number, the first and last item, a value exactly at a limit. A path that throws, renders nothing useful, or computes a wrong result for one of them is a finding.

**Timezone.** When the app configures a time zone, a date formatted or parsed without it follows the machine's zone. `Intl.DateTimeFormat` without a `timeZone` option, or a string with no offset parsed by `new Date()`, is the common shape. Grep the repo for how it configures the zone before flagging, and cite it.

### §B3. Data shape

Check the declared type of every value that crosses a boundary against what actually arrives: the API contract, the props a caller passes, what storage returns, what a URL or form field holds (always a string). Drift between the contract and the type, an `as` cast that asserts the expected shape instead of checking it, and `any` carrying a wrong type through are findings here when the runtime value can differ from the type. State the mismatch: what the type says, what arrives, and where.

### §B4. Regression

Do not trust the PR description for this box; check the history. For every symbol the diff changes, search the changelog, the repo's dev logs if it keeps them, and `git log -S <symbol> --oneline` for an earlier fix to the same code. When one exists, read it and confirm the diff does not undo it (a guard removed, a boundary rule reverted, a workaround deleted without the cause being fixed). The receipt names the sources searched and the commits found, or `no prior fix found` with the search stated.

## Sweeps

Save the diff under review to a file and run the script over it; `-` reads the diff from stdin. No other sweep is bundled for this topic.

- `added-lines.sh` (citation map): every added line as `path:line: text`, with the source line number at the head SHA. Cite every finding's line from this output or from a sweep hit, never from a position in the diff file.

  ```bash
  bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/added-lines.sh" <diff-file>
  ```
